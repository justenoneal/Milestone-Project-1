# Milestone Project 1
 A browser game for SDSU coding bootcamp

When the player and enemy are defeated in the same turn the player loses. This is intended behavior.

Transitions will be added to screen changes.

I'd like to add:
- A page for accessories so that players can customize their stats.
- A secret boss that shows up when a player defeats the final boss with at least 80% of their hp.
- better backgrounds and styling.
- BMG and sound effects
